    <p>Before a new employee can be put into the HR system, a hirable candidate gets selected through rounds of interviews.  An initial pool of candidates goes through
        2 initial interviews, then a final round of 3 interviews.  Once a candidate is selected, they are entered into the system as a new employee.  A starting salary
        is negotiated, and thier status is determined.  They can be hired as a contract employee or a Full Time employee.  If they are a contractor, they are eligible
        for a $1000.00 signing bonus.  All new employees can also have their starting salary raised by increments of 2500 for every "special" skill they posess.  These
        are skills that are highly sought out by the company for this position.
